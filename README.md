# Iron Counsel 🐦‍⬛

> *"A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone."* — Tyrion Lannister

A Telegram bot powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** that responds as
**The Iron Counsel** — a darkly absurdist strategic advisor from the Seven Kingdoms
now inexplicably tasked with solving your mundane 21st-century problems.
Every answer is structured as ⚔️ The Decree / 📜 The Counsel / ☠️ The Warning,
delivered in both **English and Traditional Chinese**, weaving in real GoT character quotes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 0. Prerequisites (see below for details)
cp .env.example .env                                             # fill in your values
cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars # fill in your values

# 1. Provision all GCP infrastructure + sync GitHub Actions variables automatically
make infra-init BUCKET=my-tf-state-bucket
make infra-apply

# 2. Download & embed GoT quotes (produces vectors.json — runs fully locally)
make kaggle-download
make embed CSV=Game_of_Thrones_Script.csv

# 3. Upload vectors to Firestore
make upload-prod

# 4. Create the Firestore vector index (once after first upload)
make vector-index

# 5. Push to GitHub — CI/CD deploys automatically
git push origin master

# 6. Register the Telegram webhook (once after first deploy)
make webhook

# 7. Test locally with Docker Compose
make dev
```

Run `make help` to see all available commands.

## Three-Phase Deployment

```
Phase 1 ── terraform apply              → Provisions all GCP resources + sets GitHub Actions variables
Phase 2 ── make ingest-prod (local)     → Embeds GoT quotes with fastembed → writes to Firestore
Phase 3 ── deploy.yml (push to master)  → Tests → Build Docker → Push → Deploy Cloud Run
```

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) | Local dev stack |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Python dependency management |
| [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) | GCP auth + Firestore index creation |
| [Terraform ≥ 1.6](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) | Infrastructure provisioning |
| A **GCP project** | Firestore + Cloud Run (all APIs enabled by Terraform) |
| A **Telegram bot token** | From [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) |
| A **[Groq](https://console.groq.com) API key** | LLaMA 3.3 70B inference (free tier) |
| A **GitHub PAT** | Fine-grained token with *Actions variables: Read & write* — Terraform sets CI/CD vars automatically |
| A **GCS bucket** for Terraform state | Created once manually |

> **No embedding API key required.** Both ingestion and query-time embeddings run locally

> and Cloud Run (Linux x86_64 / arm64).

---

## Local Development

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (.venv created automatically)
uv sync

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: TELEGRAM_TOKEN, GCP_PROJECT_ID, GROQ_API_KEY, etc.

# 3. Run directly (without Docker)
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080

# 4. Run tests
make test
```

---

## Local Testing with Docker Compose

Docker Compose runs a **Firestore emulator** alongside the API. Groq calls go to
the real API — only Firestore is mocked locally. **Emulator data persists across
restarts** via a named Docker volume (`firestore-data`).

### Step 1 — Configure `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in at minimum:

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=any-random-string
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=        # leave blank to allow everyone, or comma-sep IDs
```

### Step 2 — Start the stack

```bash
make up
# or: docker compose up --build
```

This starts:
- `firestore` — Firestore emulator on `localhost:8081`
- `app` — FastAPI server on `localhost:8080` with hot-reload, wired to the emulator

Wait for:
```
iron-counsel-app-1  | INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Step 3 — Ingest quotes into the emulator

In a **separate terminal** (keep `make up` running):

```bash
# Embed all 23k+ quotes locally with fastembed (no API key needed)
make embed CSV=Game_of_Thrones_Script.csv

# Upload vectors to the emulator
make upload
```

The model (~70MB ONNX) is downloaded automatically on first run and cached in
`~/.cache/fastembed/`. Embedding runs at full CPU speed — no API rate limits.
`vectors.json` is reusable: if you need to re-upload, run only `make upload`.

### Step 4 — Test the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/

# Direct RAG test (no Telegram needed — DEBUG=true is set in docker-compose.override.yml)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Who is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?"}'

# Simulate a Telegram webhook update
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token: ${TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET}" \
  -d '{
    "message": {
      "chat": {"id": 123},
      "from": {"id": 123},
      "text": "Who is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?"
    }
  }'
```

> **`/chat` endpoint:** Only available when `DEBUG=true` (set automatically by
> `docker-compose.override.yml`). It lets you test RAG responses directly without
> needing a real Telegram account or webhook setup.

### Step 5 — Tear down

```bash
make down
# or: docker compose down
```

> **Hot-reload:** The override file (`docker-compose.override.yml`) mounts `./app` into
> the container and starts uvicorn with `--reload`. Changes to `app/` take effect
> immediately without rebuilding the image.

---

## Phase 1: Infrastructure (Terraform)

### 1. Create the Terraform state bucket (once)

```bash
gcloud storage buckets create gs://my-tf-state-bucket \
  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

### 2. Configure variables

```bash
cd terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Fill in: project_id, region, groq_api_key, telegram_token,
#          telegram_webhook_secret, github_repo, github_token, tf_state_bucket
```

**`github_token`** — create a fine-grained PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens:
select your repo → Permissions → **Actions variables: Read & write**.

### 3. Initialise and apply

```bash
make infra-init BUCKET=my-tf-state-bucket
make infra-apply
```

`terraform apply` provisions all GCP resources **and automatically sets all 6 GitHub
Actions variables** in your repo via the GitHub provider. No manual steps in the GitHub UI.

### 4. Note the outputs

```
cloud_run_url              = "https://iron-counsel-xxxx-uc.a.run.app"
artifact_registry_repo     = "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/project/iron-counsel"
workload_identity_provider = "projects/.../providers/github-provider"
deploy_service_account     = "iron-counsel-deploy-sa@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
cloud_run_service_name     = "iron-counsel"
```

### 5. Create the Firestore vector index (once)

```bash
make vector-index
```

Index creation takes a few minutes. Monitor in GCP Console → Firestore → Indexes.

---

## Phase 2: Data Ingestion

Ingestion is **always run locally** using fastembed — no API costs, no rate limits,
no external dependencies. It is split into two phases so you can re-upload without
re-embedding.

### 1. Download the dataset

```bash
# Option A — Kaggle CLI
make kaggle-download

# Option B — Manual download from:
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albenft/game-of-thrones-script-all-seasons
```

### 2. Embed (CSV → vectors.json)

```bash
make embed CSV=Game_of_Thrones_Script.csv
```

Embeds ~24k quotes with `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`
(384 dims, multilingual including Mandarin) via fastembed in batches of 500 and writes
`vectors.json`. The ~70MB ONNX model is downloaded once and cached automatically.
`vectors.json` is reusable — skip straight to step 3 if it already exists.

### 3. Upload (vectors.json → Firestore)

```bash
# Local emulator (must be running via 'make up')
make upload

# Production
make upload-prod
```

All Firestore batch commits run concurrently — typically completes in seconds.

### Combined shortcut

```bash
# Does embed + upload in one command (skips embed if vectors.json already exists)
make ingest CSV=Game_of_Thrones_Script.csv        # → local emulator
make ingest-prod CSV=Game_of_Thrones_Script.csv   # → production
```

---

## Phase 3: CI/CD (Continuous Deployment)

Every push to `master` automatically:

1. **Runs tests** (`pytest`) — blocks deploy on failure
2. **Builds** the Docker image and pushes to Artifact Registry (tagged with commit SHA)
3. **Deploys** the new image to Cloud Run

No secrets are stored in GitHub — authentication uses **Workload Identity Federation**.
GitHub Actions variables are managed entirely by Terraform.

### Register the Telegram Webhook (once after first deploy)

```bash
make webhook
```

Or manually:

```bash
SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe iron-counsel --region=us-central1 --format='value(status.url)')
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_TOKEN}/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"url\": \"${SERVICE_URL}/webhook\", \"secret_token\": \"${TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET}\"}"
```

---

## How It Works

1. User sends a message to the Telegram bot.
2. Telegram POSTs the update to `/webhook` on Cloud Run.
3. The FastAPI handler loads the user's **conversation history** from Firestore.
4. The user's query is **embedded locally** using `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` via fastembed (ONNX, no API call, multilingual).
5. A **KNN vector search** finds the top-5 most relevant GoT quotes in Firestore.
6. A prompt is built: system instructions + retrieved quotes + chat history + user query.
7. **LLaMA 3.3 70B** (via Groq) generates a response, weaving the quotes into its answer.
8. Both the user message and the assistant reply are **saved to Firestore** for future context.
9. The response is sent back to the user via the Telegram Bot API.
